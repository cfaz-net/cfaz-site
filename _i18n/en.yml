      title: "What our customers are saying"
      testimony1: "<b>Dr. Guilherme A. R. Resende</b><br/><small class='text-white'>Director of Clinics Imagem e Odontologia Digital</small>"
      testimony_text1: "I chose Cfaz.net because at the time they already had a futuristic proposal, offering a 100% online system and the possibility of integrating all units. With the implementation, I encouraged myself to open new units, as everything would be under my control, and even in the palm of my hand, through the cell phone."
      testimony2: "<b>Dra. Maria Betânia da Silveira e Souza</b><br/><small class='text-white'>Directress of Clinics ROC</small>"
      testimony_text2: "Cfaz.net is software that has a heart. In addition to the professionalism offered, this was the differential that made us loyal to the system. The partnership eliminated bureaucracy and, therefore, we work with more freedom. This makes the Radiologist + Dentist + Patient relationship much more efficient and humane. The quantitative results are consequences of the harmony and pleasure of the team's work."
      testimony3: "<b>Dr. Pedro Lima Emmerich Oliveira</b><br/><small class='text-white'>Director of Clinics Craniofacial</small>"
      testimony_text3: "Craniofacial and Cfaz have built a working relationship supported by trust and friendship. The software's functionality has often been updated according to Craniofacial's needs. Cfaz.net has simplified company processes, exam deliveries are faster and quality control is more active."
      testimony4: "<b>Dra. Larissa Veloso</b><br/><small class='text-white'>Directress of the Clínicas Axial</small>"
      testimony_text4: "Unlike the old program we used, which was slow, with an outdated layout and the most absurd for today: it needed to be installed on the computer, Cfaz.net is super fast, practical and intuitive. You don't need to install anything, just enter your email and password and you're done! It's super modern and with great support assistance! In my opinion, they are the ones that present the best way to work in Dental Radiology. The team is very nice, full of spectacular innovations."
      testimony5: "<b>Dra. Ângela Maragno</b><br/><small class='text-white'>Directress of Clínica Precisão</small>"
      testimony_text5: "Before I got to know Cfaz.net, I had problems with technical assistance and charging for each new update. Cfaz's service is fast and efficient and system updates are constant and free. I recommend the solution to several colleagues and friends, as I think Cfaz.net is an excellent alternative for managing the flow of care and administrative services in the clinic, in addition to being completely online, without the need to download heavy programs, easy to use and intuitive, with cloud storage and space to store DICOM files. Congratulations for your work and dedication!"
      testimony6: "<b>Dra. Patrícia Fernandes Avila</b><br/><small class='text-white'>Directress of Clínica Precisão</small>"
      testimony_text6: "I chose Cfaz.net as my clinic's management software due to its practicality, clarity and good service, which is always impeccable. As a result of this partnership, I got faster processes and what I like most about the system is its ease of handling and agility, the possibility of integration with the equipment and automatic sending to the dentist."
