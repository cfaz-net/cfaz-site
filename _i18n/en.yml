      testimony_text1: "I chose Cfaz.net because at the time they already had a futuristic proposal, offering a 100% online system and the possibility of integrating all units. With the implementation, I encouraged myself to open new units, as everything would be under my control, and even in the palm of my hand, through the cell phone."
      testimony2: "<b>Dra. Maria Betânia da Silveira e Souza</b><br/><small class='text-white'>Directress of Clinics ROC</small>"
      testimony_text2: "Cfaz.net is software that has a heart. In addition to the professionalism offered, this was the differential that made us loyal to the system.
